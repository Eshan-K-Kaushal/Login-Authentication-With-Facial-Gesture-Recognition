# Login-Authentication-With-Facial-Gesture-Recognition
Just a basic implemented framework of the idea. More can be done in future implmentation


Future implementations include:-
• Recognize more gestures:
We plan to add more gestures into our system such as waving hands and opening mouth. The increasing number of random gestures will make the user harder to predict the move, and thus improve the security of the system.

 • Test with more people and a larger image set:
We plan to test with more people and get a more precise result of how accurate our system is on recognizing users’ faces and gestures. We will also improve the accuracy of the system by training and testing with a larger image set.

 • Store and encrypt face data in a separate database:
The photos of the users in the database have a potential security issue. To solve that, we plan to store and encrypt the photos of the user in a separate database so that even if the database is being hacked, the photos will not leak.

 • Replace user’s photo with face encoding:
 To bring the security of our system to the next level, we could only store the characteristics of the user’s face in the database instead of the photo. Even if the face encoding data is leaked, the hacker cannot recover user’s face.
 • Remove the need for password in our implementation:
 
 When our system reaches really high accuracy, we could remove process of entering the password during login. User’s account can be verified with facial recognition as the single security check.
